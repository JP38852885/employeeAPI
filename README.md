## Oauth2

In this Spring security oauth2 tutorial, learn to build an authorization server to authenticate your identity to provide access_token, which you can use to request data from resource server.

***Introduction to OAuth 2*** OAuth 2 is an authorization method to provide access to protected resources over the HTTP protocol. Primarily, oauth2 enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service –

- either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service
- or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

**OAuth2 Roles:** There are four roles that can be applied on OAuth2:

- `Resource Owner`: The owner of the resource — this is pretty self-explanatory.
- `Resource Server`: This serves resources that are protected by the OAuth2 token.
- `Client`: The application accessing the resource server.
- `Authorization Server`: This is the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

**OAuth2 Tokens:** Tokens are implementation specific random strings, generated by the authorization server.

- `Access Token`: Sent with each request, usually valid for about an hour only.
- `Refresh Token`: It is used to get a 00new access token, not sent with each request, usually lives longer than access token.

### Quick Start a Cloud Security App

Let's start by configuring spring cloud oauth2 in a Spring Boot application for microservice security.

First, we need to add the `spring-cloud-starter-oauth2` dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-oauth2</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

This will also bring in the `spring-cloud-starter-security`dependency.

```
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And we need to add spring cloud `dependency `  in`dependencyManagement` 

```
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
			<version>${spring-cloud.version}</version>
			<type>pom</type>
			<scope>import</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Another think is now we will add spring cloud version:

`<spring-cloud.version>Greenwich.RELEASE</spring-cloud.version>`



##  spring-boot-rest-data-jpa project run

1. `git clone https://github.com/ahasanhabibsumon/spring-boot-rest-data-jpa.git`
2. `project import any IDE`
3. `Go to application.properties and make sure databasename, username, password`
4. `Run spring boot project`
5. `open postman and import in postman REST-API-CRUD.postman_collection file `
