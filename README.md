## Oauth2

In this Spring security oauth2 tutorial, learn to build an authorization server to authenticate your identity to provide access_token, which you can use to request data from resource server.

***Introduction to OAuth 2*** OAuth 2 is an authorization method to provide access to protected resources over the HTTP protocol. Primarily, oauth2 enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service –

- either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service
- or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

**OAuth2 Roles:** There are four roles that can be applied on OAuth2:

- `Resource Owner`: The owner of the resource — this is pretty self-explanatory.
- `Resource Server`: This serves resources that are protected by the OAuth2 token.
- `Client`: The application accessing the resource server.
- `Authorization Server`: This is the server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

**OAuth2 Tokens:** Tokens are implementation specific random strings, generated by the authorization server.

- `Access Token`: Sent with each request, usually valid for about an hour only.
- `Refresh Token`: It is used to get a 00new access token, not sent with each request, usually lives longer than access token.
